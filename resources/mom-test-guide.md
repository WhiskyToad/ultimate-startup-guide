# The Mom Test: Complete Guide

**By Rob Fitzpatrick** - A practical guide to customer conversations that reveal real problems instead of polite lies.

## üîë Core Principle

> "Ask questions that even your mom can't lie to you about."

People naturally want to be helpful and protect your feelings. This leads to misleading feedback that sounds positive but doesn't reflect reality. The Mom Test teaches you to ask questions that reveal truth, not politeness.

## ‚úÖ The Framework: Good Customer Conversations

### 1. Talk About Their Life, Not Your Idea

**Do:**
- Ask about their current behavior and past experiences
- Focus on their world, their problems, their solutions
- Example: "How do you currently solve [problem]?"

**Don't:**
- Pitch your idea or explain your solution
- Ask for opinions about your concept
- Make it about you or your product

### 2. Ask About Specifics, Not Generalizations

**Do:**
- "When was the last time you faced this issue?"
- "What did you do the last time this happened?"
- "How much time/money did that cost you?"

**Don't:**
- "Do you ever have this problem?"
- "How often does this happen?"
- "Would this be useful?"

### 3. Listen More Than You Talk

**Your Goal:** Learn about their world
**Not:** Convince them your idea is good

## ‚ùå Questions That Get You Lies

Avoid these types of questions that encourage false positives:

- "Do you think this is a good idea?"
- "Would you pay for this?"
- "Would you use this?"
- "How much would you pay for this?"
- "What features would you want?"

These questions put people on the spot and encourage them to give you the answer they think you want to hear.

## üß† How to Uncover Real Problems

### Look for Emotional Reactions

- Frustration when describing current solutions
- Excitement when talking about workarounds they've created
- Resignation about "just dealing with it"

### Dig Into Impact

- "How much time does this take you?"
- "What happens when you can't solve it?"
- "How much does your current solution cost?"
- "Who else is affected by this?"

### Follow the Money Trail

- What do they currently pay for?
- What alternatives have they tried?
- What's the cost of not solving this problem?

## üí¨ Great Conversation Starters

### Discovery Questions

- "Tell me about the last time you had [problem]"
- "Walk me through your process for [task]"
- "What's the hardest part about [activity]?"
- "What would have to happen for this to be a real problem for you?"

### Follow-up Questions

- "What did you do next?"
- "How did that work out?"
- "What else have you tried?"
- "Who else have you talked to about this?"
- "What happens if you don't solve this?"

## üéØ What You're Looking For

### Strong Signals

- They've already built a workaround
- They're paying for a solution (even a bad one)
- They bring up the problem without prompting
- They can give specific examples and costs
- They ask when your solution will be available

### Weak Signals

- Generic responses like "yeah, that happens sometimes"
- They can't think of specific examples
- They haven't tried to solve it before
- They say "it would be nice to have"

## üìù After the Conversation

### Document Everything

- Specific quotes and examples
- Emotional reactions you observed
- Current solutions and their costs
- Who else is involved in the problem

### Look for Patterns

- Are multiple people describing the same problem?
- Do they use similar language?
- Are the impacts consistent?
- Are current solutions similarly inadequate?

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Have more conversations** - One conversation isn't enough
2. **Find the commonalities** - Look for repeated themes
3. **Validate the problem** - Before building any solution
4. **Keep talking** - Even after you start building

## üìö Key Takeaways

- **Focus on learning, not selling**
- **Ask about the past, not the future**
- **Listen for problems, not solutions**
- **Look for evidence, not opinions**
- **Find the emotional core of the problem**

The Mom Test isn't just about asking better questions‚Äîit's about fundamentally changing how you approach customer discovery. Instead of trying to validate your idea, you're trying to understand their world.
