## 🔍 The Four Main Approaches

### 1. Mom Test
**Core Principle:** Ask questions that reveal real problems, not polite lies.

**Key Questions:**
- "Tell me about the last time you had [problem]"
- "How did you try to solve it?"
- "What else have you tried?"

**Avoid:** "Would you use this?" or "Do you like this idea?"

### 2. Community Embedding
**Core Principle:** Start with people, not ideas. Embed in communities to discover their real problems.

**Process:**
1. Pick a community you understand
2. Lurk and participate genuinely
3. Listen for repeated frustrations
4. Build solutions with them, not for them
